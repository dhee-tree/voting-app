# Best Teacher Website 
###### By Students, For Teachers

This is a website created by the second year Lv 3 IT students of Peterborough College (Grad. 2022)

## Background to Project
At the beginning of my Level 3 first year, we had an induction which included a virtual tour. The tour showed us exciting works, images from other departments, but none from ours. This raised questions, curiosity and a desire to have images from our department on that tour.

## Purpose
A website created by Level 3 IT students of Peterborough College (Grad. 2022), to collect student votes for the ***Best Teacher*** award to an IT lecturer.

## Plan
To achieve the goal we are relying on contribution and time investment from students, resource help from teachers.

The project would be developed and deployed using *online IDE* **Replit** and **GitHub**. Both platforms provide remote access, team collaboration, version control, testing capabilities, web hosting and more.

Website to have five pages; home, code, voting, success vote and results page. See [Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14LhrWhSP0YzBVImPPuFdOkEAGBql6S2qNHC6fDzZq_k/edit?usp=sharing), [Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/bH6OJ6EQKpY06QkakktooN/College-Voting?node-id=0%3A1)

## Requirements 
- Unique code generated for students.
- Student access voting website.
- Unique code verified.
